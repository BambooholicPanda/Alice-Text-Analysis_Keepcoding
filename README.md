# Data Analysis of Alice in Wonderland
### Bootcamp exercises + Self planned data analysis


In this project, we are encouraged to take Alice in Wonderland's text and to clean it for latter processing. 

#### 🗒️👣The text cleaning steps are as follows:
* Splitting the text into separate words
* Eliminating suffixes and punctuation and turning all words into lowercase
* Eliminating stopwords ("blacklisted" words) 

Then, we keep a record of all words and how many times they have appeared in the text within a **dictionary** in which the key is the word and the value is the number of times it appeared.

#### 🔍📊Data Analysis
After completing the exercise, I decided to combine it with the Data Analytics tools that I Iearnt the previous day in Le Wagon 's *Data Analytics with Python Sprint* Workshop.

For that purpose, I exported the dictionary as a **CSV file** and I used the **pandas and matplotlib** libraries to come up with graphs that would prove some interesting points on my analysis.
